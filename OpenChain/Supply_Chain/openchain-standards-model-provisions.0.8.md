## OpenChain Model Procurement Language - A Reference Guide

## Version 1.0 DRAFT (currently version 0.7, a release candidate)

# Production Status

This document is NOT intended for use at this time. It is currently based on a PROPOSAL from the OpenChain Project community. 

# Introduction and Intent

This is a document to explore model provisions for OpenChain ISO/IEC 5230 or ISO/IEC DIS 18974 in procurement contracts and similar material. It was created with reference to the public domain Risk Grid version 12. Thank you to the OpenChain project and its community members. The original document was published under CC0 and we adopt the same licence for this document.

##

## Version 0.8

# How to read the model provisions presented below

This document contains a series of Due Diligence Questions that may be useful prior to preparation of a contract related to procurement that expresses (a) a preference for OpenChain ISO/IEC 5230 conformance or  alternatively (b) a path to conformance demonstrated by alignment with individual process points compatible with the OpenChain ISO/IEC 5230 specification.

This document is intended to be interpreted consistently with the OpenChain Specification 2.1 (ISO5230:2020) ("OpenChain"). For a copy of the OpenChain specification, please see here [insert link].
- The example language it contains below is not intended for "copy and paste" inclusion in contracts.
- It is a "thinking tool" for legal staff or other parties involved in procurement to consider some matters that may be relevant to implementing or optimizing procurement approaches related to OpenChain ISO/IEC 5230 / open source license compliance.

## A Potential Series of Due Diligence Questions to be used prior to preparation of contract in the context of OpenChain ISO/IEC 5230 adoption and use

The ideal situation is to ask a supplier or similar organization "do you use OpenChain ISO/IEC 5230" and receive the reply "yes." This is the maturity situation the project would like to see in the context of efficient, effective risk reduction, resource usage reduction and procurement complexity around open source software license compliance.

More formally, that could be expressed in procurement as two questions:

### Q1: Do you have any formal certifications or conformance assessments relating to your open source compliance activities (e.g. OpenChain, ISO/IEC 5230:2020). These can be self certifications or external certifications.

### Q2 If yes, is the software to be delivered to us developed under a program which conforms to these certifications or assessments?

In the market situation of imperfect readiness by suppliers, companies beginning their journey may be in a position to align with one or more process points compatible with ISO/IEC 5230, and increase alignment over time. From the perspective of the OpenChain Project, ideally the method of encouraging alignment is two-fold:
- demand pull from customer companies asking for OpenChain Specification(s) conformance.
- the ready availability of material to assist with these efforts.

The material below is intended to provide food for thought on both points, particularly the latter. However, please note that some questions may be broader than the requirements of ISO/IEC 5230, and should be read in the context of procurement negotiations potentially "over-asking" to provoke a response that illustrates the rationale and implantation of process choices by a supplier. It also reflects the reality of practical procurement being a case of ultimately being a compromise between two parties as a result of the procurement negotiation itself.

### Q1:	Do you have a policy for selecting, using and deploying free and open source software (FOSS) components?

### Q2:	Do you provide training to staff on selecting and incorporating FOSS into your products?

### Q3:	Do you have a process for reviewing FOSS licenses and categorising the obligations/conditions attached to them?

### Q3.1 Do you have a method of recording decisions made as to whether a particular component should be incorporated or not?

### Q3.2 Are these records attributable to specific version(s) or release(s) of software?

### Q3.3 How long are the records archived for?

### Q4:	Do you use any software tools or services to assist with open source license compliance? (For example, Black Duck, Scancode, White Source, FOSSology, SW360)

### Q5.1: Have you appointed individuals with overall responsibility for open source license compliance policies, practice and procedures?

### Q5.2: Have you appointed individuals with overall responsibility for responding to open source queries from outside the organization?

### Q6: Can you provide a complete list of open source components and their respective licensing information used in any software you use or ship?

### Q7:	Do you provide customers with all materials required by the relevant open source software licenses (e.g. source code or offers to provide source, attribution notices, installation instructions)?

### Q8:	Does your organization contribute to external open source projects? Do you have a policy for handling this?


# OpenChain based representations for use in a procurement contract

*Note: This is a set of representations and obligations to be incorporated in a procurement contract. The structure follows ISO:5230:2020. The representations may also be modified to take effect as warranties and/or indemnities depending on local law and as agreed between the parties.*

*If due diligence determines that the supplier claims to be ISO 5230:2020 compliant, the following warranties apply. If the customer is **not** compliant with ISO 5230:2020 then extra care should be taken in selecting this supplier (and they should be encouraged to implement the relevant requirements, and ideally comply with ISO 5230:2020 in its entirety, and the warranties marked with an asterisk (\*) can be deleted*

*As a further example, we also provide below a shorter set of warranties which could be used where the Supplier does claim conformance. These rely on the representation that the Supplier is conformant, but do not require details of the mode of conformance to included in the Supplier Information Pack.*
